These _LLMs Unplugged_ resources are a
[Cybernetic Studio](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/cybernetic-studio/) project
created by [Dr. Ben Swift](https://benswift.me) at the
[ANU School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au).

This work has benefited enormously from the input and facilitation help of Eddie
Aloise King and Cole Cooney and other SoCy staff, plus feedback from hundreds of
participants across diverse audiences---school students through to senior
executives in the Australian Public Service. Iterating on these materials with
real learners has been invaluable.

## Get in touch

If you have questions about the materials, sucess stories about using them in
your classroom, or would like to discuss adaptations for specific contexts, get
in touch at [ben.swift@anu.edu.au](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au)---we'd love to
hear from you.

at [github.com/ANUcybernetics/my-first-lm]({{ links.github }}), and includes:

- [Module cards]({{ links.modules }}) (printable PDF handouts)
- [Instructor notes]({{ links.instructor_notes }}) with pedagogical scaffolding
- Software tools (MIT licensed) for generating custom n-gram booklets

We encourage educators to use, adapt, and improve the material. If you've made
interesting modifications or have run successful workshops, we'd love[^love] to
hear about it---this is meant to be a living resource that evolves with use.

## About the ANU School of Cybernetics

The [School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au) at the Australian
National University takes a systems-oriented approach to understanding and
shaping technology in society. The School's
[Cybernetic Studio](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/cybernetic-studio/) develops
hands-on resources and runs workshops exploring the social, technical, and
political dimensions of emerging technologies.

_LLMs Unplugged_ reflects the School's commitment to making sophisticated
technical concepts accessible to diverse audiences and fostering critical
engagement with AI systems that increasingly mediate how we work, learn, and
communicate. Understanding how these systems actually work---not through
metaphor or handwaving but through direct experience---is what we're all about.

[^love]:
    well, technically that's a requirement of the SA clause in the CC licence,
    but it's still true that we'd love to hear about your changes :)
