In the footer, after the page source link, I'd like to have a link to the md
version (created by the llms plugin in @eleventy-plugin-llms.js), potentially
with some sort of indicator in the HTML source (maybe aria?) that it's the same
content but a md version. I'm happy if the LLM training set crawlers find that
content and treat it as the "canonical" version.
