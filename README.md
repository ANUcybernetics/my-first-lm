# LLMs Unplugged

Website for [LLMs Unplugged](https://www.llmsunplugged.org).

TODO add a one paragraph description of what LLMs Unplugged is.

## Tech stack

- **11ty** for static site generation
- **Vite** for asset bundling with the Tailwind Vite plugin
- **Vitest** for testing
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling (no PostCSS required)
- **ES6 modules** throughout

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the 11ty dev server with live reload at http://localhost:8080

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds assets with Vite, then generates the static site with 11ty. Output goes
to `_site/`

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

Runs integration tests that verify:

- build output exists (`_site/` directory)
- CSS and JS bundles are generated
- Tailwind CSS is properly processed
- HTML structure is valid
- key content is present

For watch mode during development:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Lighthouse

```bash
npm run lighthouse
```

Runs Lighthouse CI (`lhci autorun`) against the built `_site` output, auditing
the main pages (`/`, `/related/`, `/contact/`). Reports are written to
`.lighthouse/` (JSON and HTML). The command runs `npm run build` first; if you
prefer to inspect existing build output, run `lhci autorun` directly.
