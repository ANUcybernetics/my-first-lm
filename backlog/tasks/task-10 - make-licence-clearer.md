I'd actually like the _content_ on this website (as viewed by visitors) to be
the same (c) Ben Swift, CC BY-SA-NC 4.0 licence that the pdf files are under.
It's only the website source that's MIT.

Can you update this repo (perhaps tweak the footer) to reflect this? Or is there
some reason this licencing is a bad idea?
