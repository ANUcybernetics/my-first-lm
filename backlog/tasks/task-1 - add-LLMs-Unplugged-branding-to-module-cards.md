The `logos: ("studio",)` part of utils.typ means that there's a cybernetic
studio wordmark in the bottom LH margin of the output pdfs, but I'd actually
like that to say "LLMs Unplugged | Cybernetic Studio". Currently the anu typst
template doesn't allow us to configure that text, so we'll have to think of a
nice and clean way to do it.
