Want to write a news item for the website which draws on the ideas expressed elsewhere in the copy on the site, but in particular makes these points:

1. LLMs are coming in to (Aus) schools
2. training on how to use them that treats them like black boxes is good, but it's not enough
3. we need to give students at all different levels a mental model for how they work
4. LLMs Unplugged does this... use it in your classroom, and ask for help if you're stuck
