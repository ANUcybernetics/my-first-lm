There's a task (in another repo on this machine)
`/Users/ben/Documents/teaching/tools/marp-anu/backlog/tasks/task-7 - switch-to-sli-dev.md`
which sketches out a plan for adding slides with an "ANU dark" theme. The 11ty
site in website/ in this project uses a similar theme (just without the ANU
logos).

I'd like to add a sli.dev powered md -> web-based slides workflow to the 11ty
website (using vite). For example, any md files in `website/slides/` would be
automatically turned into sli.dev slides.
