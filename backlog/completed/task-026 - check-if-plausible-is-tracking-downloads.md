Look at the plausible docs here https://plausible.io/docs/custom-event-goals

For the website, I want:

- clicking on the `modules.pdf` link to trigger a "download" custom event; i.e.
  I want to track the downloads of that file

Currently clicking on the link to that pdf file just opens it in the browser,
but I'm happy to change it to a "download" link if that makes tracking easier.
