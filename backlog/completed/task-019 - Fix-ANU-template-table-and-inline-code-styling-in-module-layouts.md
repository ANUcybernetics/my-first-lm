This isn't really done... but I've gone back to the drawing board.

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->

After refactoring modules to fix two-page layout, ANU template styling for
tables and inline code is lost. Tables missing row striping, borders, header
colors. Inline code blocks not styled. Need to properly inherit ANU styles while
keeping custom page layout.
