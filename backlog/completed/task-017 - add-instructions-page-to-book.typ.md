In @book.typ after the copyright page there should be an instructions page on
how to use the book to generate new text.

It could be based on the algorighm/instructions section in
@02-basic-generation.typ, but specifically tailored for this book (with examples
of e.g. how to interpret the "3â™¢" indicators and roll multiple d10s, then find
the next word).

It doesn't need to consider the "scale to d" thing for any value of d other than
a d10, because we're moving past that. Always d10s (one or more) from now on,
and the instructions should only mention this particular case.

Potentially there should be a blank page between that and the main content as
well.
