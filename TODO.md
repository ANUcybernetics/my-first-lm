# TODO

## Rust lib

- off-by-one error in sticky page heading
- handle en/em dashes (e.g. —)
- add top-k (and even temperature) params
- add end of sentence token (perhaps ⏺)
- add the ability to generate new text from a model
- in stats, print % of non-120 words, and maybe a breakdown of 3/4/5 dice words
- (maybe) use a "number of diamonds for number of dice" indicator, instead of
  before/after the number
- add the stats to the json output (and display in the book?)
