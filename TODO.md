# TODO

## Rust lib

- bugfix for labels for n > 2; handle case where there's no label for a bigram
- check that "line normalisation" handles en/em dashes (e.g. —)
- add top-k (and even temperature) params
- add end of sentence token (perhaps ⏺)
- add the ability to generate new text from a model
- in stats, print % of non-120 words, and maybe a breakdown of 3/4/5 dice words
- add the stats to the json output (and display in the book?)

- (maybe) add page headings
